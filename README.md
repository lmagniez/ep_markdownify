# Plugin for Esc@pad's etherpad-lite instance.

This is a fork from the originial ep_markdownify plugin for etherpad-lite.
In this fork, we had to change some small part to make the code work on our etherpad-lite instance (ex: Changed the security.js reference to security)

We also deleted some features such as the image preview, in order to satisfy our need for the Esc@pad's project from Culture Num√©rique. (See https://github.com/CultureNumerique)
